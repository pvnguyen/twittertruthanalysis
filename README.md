Twitter Truth Analysis
====================

Analyzing trustworthiness of tweets on Twitter. With the plethora of information streaming in via Twitter, it is
crucial to determine the credibility of tweets in a real-time. This motivates use to use machine learning and 
stream processing to build a prototype for a system that can assess credibility to an incoming Twitter stream. 
We have tested our credibility model against trending topics on Twitter, e.g., `#MH370` and `#FortHoodShooting`,
and it shows encouraging results in detecting fraudulent tweets.

This github project is the machine learning part of the project that is plugged into Twitter streams and run on
Apache Spark. For the paper, please refer to the following link:
